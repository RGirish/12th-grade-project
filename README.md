# 12th-grade-project

This repo contains the source for the Game and Drawing Utility that I created as a Capstone project during the final year of my High School (12th Grade, in India). 

The game is a simple one - the bottom of the screen has the view of a city's landscape. The top portion of the screen has a space shuttle that goes from left to right, and randomly stops at a point and drops a bomb. The aim of the game is to shoot the bomb using the mouse pointer before it reaches the city at the bottom. 

The drawing utility is me trying to mimic MS Paint! This drawing utility is a very very basic version of MS Paint, that lets you draw on screen, paint circles/rectangles, etc and choose one of 16 colors.
